# CS210 Portfolio Project - CornerGrocerProject

## Project Summary
This project is designed to help a corner grocery store track and analyze customer purchases. It solves the problem of inventory management by providing a program that reads transaction data and displays useful insights.

## Strengths
I did particularly well in implementing file handling and data processing. The program successfully reads and processes transaction data efficiently.

## Areas for Improvement
- I could enhance error handling to better manage missing or corrupted data files.
- Implementing a more user-friendly interface would make it easier for non-technical users.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Parsing transaction data correctly was a challenge. I used debugging tools and print statements to verify the logic.
- Learning to format output in a readable manner was tricky, but using structured functions helped.

## Transferable Skills
- File handling and data processing will be useful for other programming projects.
- Debugging and problem-solving skills developed during this project apply broadly to software development.

## Code Maintainability
- The program follows structured functions to keep code modular.
- Clear comments and documentation ensure readability.
- Using proper naming conventions makes it easier to understand.
