## CS-230 Module Eight Journal Reflection
**Course:** CS-230 – Operating Platforms  
**Artifact:** Software Design Document – *The Gaming Room*  

### 1. Client Summary
The Gaming Room is a client that developed the Android game *Draw It or Lose It*, a timed drawing and guessing game similar to Pictionary. They wanted to expand it into a **web-based multiplayer platform** that could support **multiple operating systems and devices** while maintaining smooth performance and fair gameplay. Their key requirements included scalability, secure data handling, and consistent user experiences across distributed systems.

### 2. What I Did Well
I did particularly well explaining **the architectural recommendations** for the system, including operating platform comparisons, distributed system considerations, and **security strategies**. I also clearly justified why using cloud-based deployment and modular design would benefit The Gaming Room’s scalability, performance, and cost efficiency.

### 3. What I Found Helpful
Working through the **software design document (SDD)** helped me understand how planning the architecture first gives structure and direction before coding begins. Breaking the project into sections like memory management, operating systems, and security gave me a better appreciation of how each layer supports the others. It also reinforced the importance of documentation when communicating with both clients and development teams.

### 4. Area for Improvement
If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand the section on **distributed networking and data synchronization** to include more detail about how client-server communication would occur in real time. I would also add a visual diagram showing how the cloud infrastructure connects users and servers to improve technical clarity.

### 5. Interpreting User Needs
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on **cross-platform compatibility**, **fast response times**, and **data integrity**. Since The Gaming Room wanted a reliable multiplayer experience, I emphasized efficient storage management and secure network design. Considering the user’s needs is crucial because the product must function seamlessly for both players and administrators, meeting expectations for usability, stability, and security.

### 6. Approach and Future Techniques
My approach to designing the software relied on **modular design principles**, breaking components into independent, reusable parts. I also considered **cloud architecture** and **virtualization** to optimize performance and scalability. In future projects, I plan to continue using **Agile methodologies**, **UML diagrams**, and **iterative prototyping** to ensure each design remains flexible, well-documented, and aligned with user requirements.




# CS210 Portfolio Project - CornerGrocerProject

## Project Summary
This project is designed to help a corner grocery store track and analyze customer purchases. It solves the problem of inventory management by providing a program that reads transaction data and displays useful insights.

## Strengths
I did particularly well in implementing file handling and data processing. The program successfully reads and processes transaction data efficiently.

## Areas for Improvement
- I could enhance error handling to better manage missing or corrupted data files.
- Implementing a more user-friendly interface would make it easier for non-technical users.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Parsing transaction data correctly was a challenge. I used debugging tools and print statements to verify the logic.
- Learning to format output in a readable manner was tricky, but using structured functions helped.

## Transferable Skills
- File handling and data processing will be useful for other programming projects.
- Debugging and problem-solving skills developed during this project apply broadly to software development.

## Code Maintainability
- The program follows structured functions to keep code modular.
- Clear comments and documentation ensure readability.
- Using proper naming conventions makes it easier to understand.
